             <img src="media/mousepic2.jpg" alt="Mouse" style="width: 200px; height: 150px; float: left"> 
             <p> <br><strong>Mice</strong> are rodents that are known to have a pointed nose, small rounded ears, a body-length scaly tail, 
                and a high breeding rate. Female mice can give birth when they are only two months old and are able to have 6 to 10 litters per year. </p>

                <p> <br><strong>Deer Mice</strong> are wild mice that can be found living outside in rural areas. Their fur resembles the fur of a deer which is where they 
                get their name. They make their homes outdoors in hollow tree logs or piles of garbage. Deer mice are nocturnal, and like to sleep in their nests during the day. 
                They also use these nests to raise their young and to protect them against harsh weather. </p>

                   <img src="media/mousepic4.jpg" alt="House Mouse" style="width: 200px; height: 150px; float: left"> 
                   <p> <br><strong>The House Mouse</strong> is the most common rodent to be found in many parts of the world. They typically eat 15-20 times a day, 
                    typically they eat plants, but they'll also eat meat and dairy products.  </p>

                    <img src="media/MousePic.jpg" alt="Fancy Mice" style="width: 200px; height: 150px; float: right"> 
                    <p> <br><strong>Fancy Mice</strong> are the mice most often kept as pets. They are a domesticated version of the house mouse and are considered "pocket pets".
                        Fancy mice are kept as pets in many countries for a several reasons: they are relatively small, inexpensive, never need bathing, and can learn 
                        to enjoy regular handling if provided with the correct care.  </p>
